                <p>Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon River. 
                    Given the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by the people living near it because of all who came to visit and fell so in love with the rugged beauty of the river that they never left. 
                    The river corridor is lined with awe-inspiring ponderosa pine which towers over the sandy beaches in the campsites and provides shelter from sun or rain when needed. 
                    The Salmon is one of the longest undammed rivers in the United States. 
                    As a free-flowing river, the water is higher, faster, and colder in the early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer. 
                    There are good rapids all summer...but families with children who like to swim tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water more.</p>

                <p>Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere, the Green River flows towards the mighty Colorado river and the sea. 
                    High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous. 
                    This 84-mile trip runs from Sand Wash to Swaseyâ€™s Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) and boasts outstanding scenery, interesting geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric and historic human activity, and great whitewater opportunities.
                    Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark.  This designation is based on the uniqueness and rich history that the canyon tells.</p>

                <p>This is the granddaddy of all canyons and the granddaddy of all river trips. You will never forget your visit to the Grand Canyon.
                    Grand Canyon River rafting combines world-class whitewater with breathtaking scenery to make one truly unforgettable river experience. 
                    The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating whitewater rapids but with side canyons and ancient Indian ruins accessible only by river.
                    CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The rapids in the Canyon are technically rated I - X (1 - 10) to accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river variances. 
                    However, most people are familiar with the regular I - V river rating scale, so we often refer to both.</p>

                <p>Arise in the soft light of the early morning after a night spent sleeping under a beautiful starry sky. 
                    As you can see, the areas we are rafting through are some of the most beautiful in the world, and you never know what you might see around any corner. 
                    Not to mention the rapids which keep things very interesting.</p>
