      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I’m a web developer at Idaho Central Credit Union and a freelance web developer. I develop websites for startups and small businesses, to assist them in making their presence known to potential consumers at an affordable cost. On average, my service will save startups and small businesses at least 40% of the cost to have a virtual presence, and there’s no obligation to buy unless the end-product appeals to you. What do you stand to lose? </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My services are geared towards startups, small businesses, and non-profit organizations who are at that lift-off stage in their development and are ready to make an appearance on the web. My services are also compatible with those individuals who are entering the world of freelance and who wish to expand their horizons by making an online presence. The same parameters, as listed above, apply to these consumer types, also… there is no obligation to purchase my work unless the end-product appeals to you.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <p>
        We live in a modern digital world where a website is often the first impression on potential customers whether in a physical or virtual setting. In fact, approximately more than 60% of today’s purchases start online, and nearly all consumers express that a company website is definitely a factor in their purchase preferences. A reliable, well-designed website exposes your products and services to those who seek them and makes it easier for you to compete in a crowded, digital, and physical, marketplace

        A little about me
      </h4>
      <p>
        Hi visitor, I’m Freddy. As an emerging freelancer, I bring a fresh passion for web development and design. Running my own business rather than routine office work allows me more time to include other hobbies in my spare time—mountain biking, skiing, and volunteering in my community and church. Some of my passions include traveling, trying different foods, visiting family, and staying up to date on any technological advances and trends. A big one for me, also, is the flexibility of being able to do your job from anywhere in the world!
        I’m looking forward to collaborating with designers and developers who are as inspired and enthusiastic as I am. 
      </p>

      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>
        I am a positive and self-determined individual who enjoys working in the area of web development. Brainstorming ideas and figuring out solutions on how to best structure any web page, is a day-in-the-life for me. The visual presentation of a web page is very important and so I design, build, test, and improve the web page.

      <h3>Your website</h3>
      <p>
        I specialize in building small business, startups, and non-profit organization websites that help you achieve your marketing goals without breaking your budget. In fact, there’s no obligation to buy unless the end-product appeals to you. Every web design includes the following:
      </p>
      <h4>
        Responsive Design
      </h4>
      <p>
        Your website will be designed in such a way that it will adapt its layout based on the size of the viewer’s screen. This means that your website will function properly on different devices including computers, smartphones, and tablets.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Reliable Hosting
      </h4>
      <p>
        I host my client’s websites with GitHub. I have used many hosting services throughout my career as a develop/designer, and GitHub has stood the test of time in offering the best reliability and security at an affordable price.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Monthly Backups
      </h4>
      <p>
        My monthly fee will include secure offline backups of your website content. These backups serve as something like an insurance policy, in case of any malicious infiltration that results in damage to your site.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Content Updates
      </h4>
      <p>
        To guarantee its effectiveness, your website must be updated on a regular basis. My monthly fee will include these updates, along with publication of updated content and graphics that you may decide to add to your site later on. This fee will cover changes up to 25% of your website’s content in any given 30-day period.
