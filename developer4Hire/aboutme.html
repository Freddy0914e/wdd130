                <h2>A little about me</h2>
                <p>I am a positive and self-determined individual who enjoys working in the area of web development. 
                    Brainstorming ideas and figuring out solutions on how to best structure any web page, is a day-in-the-life for me. 
                    The visual presentation of a web page is very important and so I design, build, test, and improve the web page.
                </p>
                <p>I’m a web developer at Idaho Central Credit Union and a freelance web developer. 
                    I develop websites for startups and small businesses, to assist them in making their presence known to potential consumers at an affordable cost. 
                    On average, my service will save startups and small businesses at least 40% of the cost to have a virtual presence, and there’s no obligation to buy unless the end-product appeals to you.  
                </p>
                <p>My services are geared towards startups, small businesses, and non-profit organizations who are at that lift-off stage in their development and are ready to make an appearance on the web. 
                    My services are also compatible with those individuals who are entering the world of freelance and who wish to expand their horizons by making an online presence. 
                    The same parameters, as listed above, apply to these consumer types also—there is no obligation to purchase my work unless the end-product appeals to you.
                </p>
