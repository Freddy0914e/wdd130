                    I specialize in building small business, startups, and non-profit organization websites that help you achieve your marketing goals without breaking your budget. 
                    In fact, there’s no obligation to buy unless the end-product appeals to you. Every web design includes the perks listed below.

                <h2>Responsive Design</h2>
                <p>Your website will be designed in such a way that it will adapt its layout based on the size of the viewer’s screen. 
                    This means that your website will function properly on different devices including computers, smartphones, and tablets.

                <h2>Reliable Hosting</h2>
                <p>I host my client’s websites with GitHub. I have used many hosting services throughout my career as a develop/designer, 
                    and GitHub has stood the test of time in offering the best reliability and security at an affordable price.

                <p>My monthly fee will include secure offline backups of your website content. 
                    These backups serve as something like an insurance policy, in case of any malicious infiltration that results in damage to your site.

                <h2>Content Updates</h2>
                <p>To guarantee its effectiveness, your website must be updated on a regular basis. 
                    My monthly fee will include these updates, along with publication of updated content and graphics that you may decide to add to your site later on. 
                    This fee will cover changes up to 25% of your website’s content in any given 30-day period.
