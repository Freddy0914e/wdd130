    <h2>Freddy Dominguez</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone. Let me tell you a little about myself. My name is Freddy and I’m originally from El Salvador. My parents brought me to the states when I was 12 years old. I have lived in NC, AR, and then back to NC. I recently moved to Idaho – 1.5 years ago- and currently reside here in the city of Pocatello. I’ve been a member of the church since 2008 and served my mission in San Fernando CA, so I lived there for the 2 years.</p>
    <p>I’m working on developing meaningful hobbies. I mostly just work, come home, watch movies, and occasionally hang out with friends/family. But recently, I’ve had a spark of adventure and have picked up mountain biking. I also plan on signing up for Ski lessons and maybe even snowboarding.  </p>
    <p>I’m currently single, and have no children or prior marriage. I currently work for a bank called ICCU (Idaho Central Credit Union), in their collections department. I’m working towards my Bachelor of Science in Applied Technology, coming out of the Pathway program, and hope to get into ICCU’s IT department and work in the Technical Support area. I’m taking this class to decide whether I want my 3rd certificate to be in either Programming or Web development. I feel this class will help me settle on one or the other. </p>
    <p>The main thing I love about BYU-I is that it brings the spirit into schoolwork. I also like how it truly cares about the individual and not a number.</p>
